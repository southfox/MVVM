# weather (MVVM)

Weather app to work with swift under iPhone & Apple Watch.

Works with windguru rest service.

Uses cocoapods: AlamofireObjectMapper (great thing to use rest + json parsing + map objects automatically)

It contains 2 branches, one with only MVC, and another using MVVM (the name of the branches are self-explanatory :))

Remember to do first:

# pod install

# MVVM
